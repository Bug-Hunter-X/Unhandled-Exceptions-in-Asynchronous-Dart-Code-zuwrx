# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient exception handling within asynchronous functions. The `bug.dart` file showcases code that only prints exceptions instead of gracefully handling them.  The solution, in `bugSolution.dart`, shows the correct way to address this by using `try-catch` blocks effectively.
